## project1: [price of used cars in Montreal](https://github.com/neimali/GRM_used_car_price)

+ Created a tool that estimates price of used car to help buyers and sellers know better the market price
+ Scraped over 4000 advertiments of used cars from Kijiji using python and beautifulsoup4
+ Performed EDA and Engineered attributes of used cars into features that can be fed to models
+ Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model
+ Built a client facing API with flask

## Project2: [League of Legends winning rate: Project Overview](https://github.com/neimali/league-of-legends-winning-rate)
+ Utilize machine learning techniques to help League of Legends coaches and players develop strategies
+ Performed EDA to check the relationship between features and matches results and select features for futher analysis and prediction
+ optimized a Logistical Regression model and a XGboost Random Forest model using gridsearchCV to get the best estimator
+ Used the coefficient and feature importance of trained models to quantify and analyze the influence of each element on match result
+ Provide suggestions according to the analysis

## Project3: [US prescribers reports](https://github.com/neimali/PrescriberPipeline)
+ Create two reports on detail of prescribers in US. 1. Reported number of prescribers and total prescription prescibed of each city. 2. Reported Top 50 prescribers in each state
+ Preprocessed and transform data on YARN by pyspark and SQL command for report generataion 
+ Stored reformatted data in Hadoop distributed file system and persisted data on Amazon S3.
+ Perform an unit test to make sure functions were applied correctly.


## Project4: [Social media likes prediction](https://github.com/neimali/socialmedia)
Goal: predict the number of likes for profiles on social media given 24 columns of structured data.
+ Collaborated with other 3 classmates to build and fine-tuned Xgboost and achieved a 1.60 RMSLE score. Independently performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and feature engineering.


## Peoject5: [Pruning Tiny-Bert](https://github.com/neimali/ift6010/blob/main/tex/final-report.pdf)
Collaborated with 2 teammates designing and implementing pruning strategies for Tiny-Bert by PyTorch, which reduced inference time by an average of 13% while maintaining similar accuracy.
